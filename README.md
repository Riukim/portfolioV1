# MY PERSONAL WEB PORTFOLIO
## :clapper: Video Presentation:  https://youtu.be/Ekym_YArgCE


## :label: **Description**
This project represents the culmination of my journey with CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science. 
It is a personal portfolio web page designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in the field of web development and information technology, accumulated during this course. 

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, coupled with Bootstrap, the webpage is crafted to provide a clean and visually appealing interface, that adapts to various screen sizes and devices, and it allows visitors to learn about my background, skills, and ongoing projects.

For now, the projects section consists of placeholders. As I continue to expand my skills, new projects to showcase to potential employers will be added. Similarly, the various social media and contact links are also placeholders, ready to be replaced with links to professional accounts.

## üìÅ File Structure

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file serves as the landing page for the portfolio. It's designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my skill and experience. The page is organized into section like About, Experience, Projects and Contacts, each designed to offer concise information and to facilitate the navigation. This structure ensure that visitors can easily explore the web page and find all of the essential details in one place, enhancing their overall browsing experience.

2. **style.css**: The CSS file is responsible for styling the entire web page. It includes styling rules for layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness for optimal view on different devices. Specific classes and IDs are used to target elements and ensure a consistent design across different sections.

3. **images/**: This directory stores all the images used in the portfolio, including logos, project screenshots, and certificates. Proper organization within this folder enhances maintainability and makes it easy to update or add new images.

4. **script.js**: While the current version of the portfolio may not heavily rely on JavaScript, this script file is included for potential future enhancements. It can be used to add interactivity, dynamic content loading, or other client-side functionalities.

## üé® Design Choices

### Responsive Design

The portfolio is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. The use of Bootstrap classes and a mobile-first approach contributes to the adaptability of the web page.

### Minimalistic and Clean

The design follows a minimalistic and clean aesthetic, emphasizing clarity and simplicity. This choice aims to make information easily accessible and reduce visual clutter, allowing visitors to focus on the content.

### Sectional Organization

Each section of the portfolio is organized to serve a specific purpose, providing an organized and logical flow of information. For example, the "Experience" section follows the "About" section to give visitors an immediate understanding of my background before delving into technical details.

### Readability and Accessibility

The use of clear and legible fonts, sufficient color contrast, and descriptive alt text for images ensures that the portfolio is accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual impairments.

### Consistent Branding

A consistent color scheme, font choice, and logo placement contribute to a cohesive branding experience. This helps in establishing a recognizable and professional identity.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

As the portfolio evolves, future enhancements may include interactive features, more detailed project descriptions, a section to include a resume that visitors can download and view, and integration with additional technologies or frameworks. Regular updates will be made to reflect ongoing learning and new accomplishments.

## üöÄ Conclusion

This web portfolio serves as a representation of the skills and experiences accumulated during the completion of CS50x, providing a platform to showcase my journey in the world of web development and coding in general.
